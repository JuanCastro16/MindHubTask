          <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
          <p>
            <span></span>The common interest that members of the Association
            share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship
            and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator,
            administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose
            is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

          <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>1. DIMENSIONS.</strong>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
            external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width
            and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields
            used by teams under 12 and older.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the
            competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
            districts or associations participating in the state competition
            program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
            requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
            the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
            be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are
            unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all
            their games away.
          </p>
          <strong>3. FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>
          <p>
            a. U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
            areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.
            b. U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
            c. U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in
            width. d. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have
            their internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.

            <span></span>All-play means that every recreation player on every
            team shall play atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the
            competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each
            game.

                games, and injuries.
